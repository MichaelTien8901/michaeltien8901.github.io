This project show the steps to convert STM32 USB CDC to WINUSB Device with HAL library.  This will change the source code of CDC USB HAL library.  "CDC" name will be retained in order to show the differenece.  Also with Microsoft OS String Descriptor, no need to install WINUSB driver for Windows 10.

## Create STM32 USB CDC device using CubeMX.
   
   Using STM32F072 Discovery board

## Implement echo function
   Changes of usbd_cdc_if.c and main.c to implement simple echo function.

## Convert CDC USB device to WINUSB device
  Change source code of USB library.  Create a DeviceInterfaceGUID = {13eb360b-bc1e-46cb-ac8b-ef3da47b4062}
  The DeviceInterfaceGUID is written into both OSStringPropertyDescriptor and INF file.

## Create Windows 7 Driver 
  Create my_winusb.inf using DeviceInterfaceGUID as described previously.
  The inf file need to match the VID, PID, and DeviceInterfaceGUID of the USB device.
  Only Windows 7 and before need install driver.  

## Create Echo Test Win Form program using WINUSBNET library
   
   Use WINUSBNET library from [https://github.com/madwizard-thomas/winusbnet](https://github.com/madwizard-thomas/winusbnet) to create simple echo test program using Visual Studio with C# WinForm
   
## Create STM32F4 WinUSB example

   Using STM32F4 Discovery board with generate project using TrueStudio.  There is not much difference from F0.

## Driver Installation using Zadig

   Another option to install drivers is using [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/). 
   The usage of Zadig can be found at [here.](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/wiki/Zadig).  

   * Advanced Mode (Options ? Advanced Mode) 

     In this mode we can configure our device with defined values.

   * Open Preset (Device ? Load Preset Device)
    
     Load the predefined values(especially "Device Interface GUID") for the device driver.  The sample config.ini is in the folder "Zadig".
