# ST25 NFC Tag Experiment

## ST25 NFC Tag
 
   Went to ST Technology Tour Vancouver this Tuesday.  The name tag is actually a ST25 NFC/RFID tag.  Let me try to figure out 
   what's in it.
   
   1. Download "ST25 NFC Tag" in Google Play.
   2. Enable NFC in Settings
   3. Tap to the Android phone
      It show the NFC type and NDEF records are empty.
      
## Add NDEF record 
   * Add "https://MichaelTien8901.github.io"   
   * Exit the App.  Tag the phone again.
